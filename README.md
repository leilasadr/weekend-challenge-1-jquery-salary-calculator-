The Salary Calculator 

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This project is a web application that allows users to add their information by clicking a 'Submit' button by using the input form that collects the employee's first name, last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary. 

Upon submission, the application calculates the monthly cost for each employee by summing their annual salary and dividing that by 12. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, the total monthly cost should have a red background color, and the application should append this information to the DOM, clear the input fields, and display this information on the web page. 

In addition to adding employees, the application should allow the user to delete an employee from the DOM. This was achieved by adding a 'Delete' button that removes an employee's information from the DOM.
